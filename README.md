# World-Happiness_Python
Analysis of the World Happiness data set

## Objective

The objective is to see which countries are the happiest, and what affects a country's happiness the most. 

## Data 

For this analysis, I used a World Happiness dataset from Kaggle. The happiness scores and rankings use data from the Gallup World Poll.  The data spans between 2013 - 2017, and it contains variables such as Country/Region, Happiness Rank, Happiness Score, Economy (GDP per Capita), Family, Health (Life Expectancy), Freedom, Trust (Government Corruption), Generosity, Dystopia Residual.
